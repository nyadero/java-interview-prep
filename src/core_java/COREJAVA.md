## Why is java not a purely Object-Oriented-Programming Language
    For a language to be considered an OOP language. it must satisfy the following:
    1. Encapsulation/Data Hiding
    2. Inheritance
    3. Polymorphism
    4. Abstraction
    5. All predefined types are objects
    6. All user defined types are objects
    7. All operations performed on objects must be only through methods exposed at the objects

    Java is purely OOP language because it has 8 primitive data types that are not objects. 
    Java also has static variables and methods
